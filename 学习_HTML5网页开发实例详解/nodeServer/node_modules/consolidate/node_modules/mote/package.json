I was experimenting with [Handlebars][hb]\nand [dust][du], Twitter had just released [hogan][ho], and I thought it would\nbe fun to write a mustache implementation.\n\nI got it working, then set about trying to make it fast. I didn't think I could\nbe competitive with the existing libraries, but I tried anyway. After all, this\nwas just supposed to be a toy.\n\nMuch to my surprise, it ended up being really fast.\n\n[spec]: https://github.com/mustache/spec\n[mujs]: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/\n[hb]: http://handlebarsjs.com/\n[ho]: http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/\n[du]: http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- utilities for server-side compilation\n- documentation\n\n",
